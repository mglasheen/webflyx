Cool Stuff, dude!

Indeed. Stuff is cool, since anything that is cool must consist of stuff - otherwise, it would not be perceptible and thus unconsidered of its coolness; however, ever the balance of forces, stuff is also uncool - and, arguably, non-stuff is uncool, since it would undesirable for us cool stuff to be non-stuff.
